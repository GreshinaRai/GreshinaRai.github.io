    <p>Using iframes can lead to issues such as cross-origin restrictions, and they can also affect SEO negatively if not used carefully. 
        Always ensure that the content you are embedding respects the policies of the sites involved and consider user experience when implementing iframes in your web applications.
        And frameset layout efficiently divides the page into two sections without using frames, providing a better experience for users and improving compatibility with modern web practices.
        In HTML, the frameset and frame elements were used to create a layout consisting of multiple independent sections, or "frames," within a single browser window.
        A frameset replaces the body element and is used to define how frames are arranged—either in rows or columns—while each frame specifies a separate HTML document to be displayed within that space.
        However, the use of frames and framesets led to various usability and accessibility issues, such as complications in navigation and bookmarking, as well as difficulties for search engine indexing. 
        Due to these drawbacks, both elements have been deprecated in HTML5, with modern alternatives like CSS for layout and JavaScript for dynamic content now preferred for creating responsive and user-friendly web designs.
